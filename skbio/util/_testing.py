class TestRunner(object):
    """Simple wrapper class around nosetests functionality.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str
        __file__ attribute passed in from the caller. This tells the
        tester where to start looking for tests.

    Notes
    -----
    The primary purpose of this class is to create an interface which users
    of scikit-bio can use to run all of the built in tests. Normally this
    would be done by invoking nosetests directly from the command line, but
    scikit-bio needs several additional options which make the command long
    and ugly. This class invokes nose with the required options.
